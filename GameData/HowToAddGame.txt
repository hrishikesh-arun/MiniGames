How to add a java game or app to MiniGames:

Step 1: Make a directory inside games folder with your game name in camel case
Example: Game Name: 'Word Exercise' Folder: .\games\wordExercise\
Step 2: Copy your game's code to the folder.
Step 3: Add the following line of code to your game's source code on the first line:
package games.myGame;
Example: games.wordExercise;

Step 4: Compile your source code
Step 5: Edit MiniGames.java in these parts

// Import Games
import games.wordleCMD.WordleGame;
import games.nim.NimGame;
// Import your game here; For Example
import games.wordExercise.WordExercise;



case "2":
	NimGame ng = new NimGame();
	break;

// Add your games here For example:
case "3":
	WordExercise we = new WordExercise();
	break;

Step 6: Edit instructions.txt in MiniGames\GameData (Not your GameData folder, if you have)

In the options section add like this
Example:
2: Nim
3: Tix Tax Tox {Another game of yours}
x: Word Exercise

This will help the users to pick the game they want form the options.

Step 7: run runMiniGames.java and check for any errors and rectify them.
Step 8: Publish your MiniGames mod to Github as a pull request. (Allowed after v1.0)
Enjoy!

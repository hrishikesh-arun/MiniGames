# MiniGames

 MiniGames is a games platform where you can play minigames such as Wordle, Nim etc.
 
 It is programmed in Java

 It utilises the package myLib for file and input control and runJava.bat for the execution of code.
 
> __Note__: Currently the main MiniGames.java doesn't exist. I hope to make it soon.
